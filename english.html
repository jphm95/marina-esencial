                <h3 class="willkommen-title">My Inner Journey <br> </h3>
                <p class="willkommen-paragraph">Even as a child, I often couldn’t reconcile what adults said with what
                    they did. Only later, as an adult, did I understand what that was about. They said one thing and did
                    another. They would speak words, but feel something completely different. It was very confusing.
                    <br>
                    As a teenager, I already knew that I would one day need therapy – and I did go. I felt that
                    something wasn’t right with me. I felt trapped within myself. My mind was full of questions—why are
                    people the way they are, and why is life so hard? It was exhausting. My heart was full of confusion
                    about myself and everything around me.

                    <br>
                </p>
                <p class="willkommen-paragraph">At about eighteen, I began meditating regularly in a group. I stayed for
                    ten years and took Bach flower remedies during that time. At twenty-three, I moved out of my
                    parents' home, and my very first action was to find a therapist. We worked on my psyche for five
                    years. These confusions and entanglements slowly began to dissolve—and successfully so! After that,
                    I explored Polarity Therapy and Kinesiology, and eventually came to Family Constellations. It took
                    around ten years to resolve most of it.

                </p>
                <p class="willkommen-paragraph">On the search for myself, I spent the most intense years doing Family
                    Constellation work. It was often very difficult to look at all the issues and traumas and to fully
                    feel the suppressed emotions. Despite all of it, I would do it again. After many small steps, a big
                    step always followed. That was my reward. Through this process, I gained a lot of self-awareness,
                    grew stronger and clearer inside, and began to heal.After more than ten years of studying my own
                    life, I trained in Systemic Family Constellations.
                </p>
                <p class="willkommen-paragraph">I am deeply grateful to the people who helped me take all the small and
                    large steps in my personal development. Today, I can say: “I’ve almost created myself into the
                    person I wanted to become.” It wasn’t easy, but my life kept getting better and better. And you know
                    what? I’m still going—towards becoming someone I might not even dare to dream of.

                </p>
                <p class="willkommen-paragraph willkommen-weight">You can do it too! Are you in?
                </p>
                <p class="willkommen-paragraph willkommen-weight">I guide people who feel the need for change in order
                    to move forward—people looking for solutions when old relationships or patterns no longer work,
                    people who want to heal their inner child.
                </p>
                <h3 class="willkommen-title">My Professional Path</h3>
                <p class="willkommen-paragraph">My professional path has many facets. After training in office
                    administration and working for a few years at a school secretary’s office, I soon realized that I
                    wanted more for myself and my life. By the age of twenty, I already had the desire to work with
                    children. But I knew I had to heal myself first. Shortly before turning thirty, I made the decision
                    to train as an early childhood educator. This decision was difficult for me—it meant letting go of
                    financial stability and old structures. But I knew it was the right thing to do.
                </p>
                <p class="willkommen-paragraph">I worked in daycare centers and also took part-time jobs in the
                    hospitality industry, at various events, and as a language teacher. Some of the most fulfilling and
                    enriching years I experienced were as a nanny for a family.In daycare centers, I often felt a lack
                    of meaningful, supportive activities, as well as structure and awareness. I wanted to offer the
                    children more than just supervision. This need was finally met through my training in Montessori
                    education for children aged 3 to 6.
                </p>
                <h3 class="willkommen-title">Languages</h3>
                <p class="willkommen-paragraph">I love languages. I was born in Switzerland, but I grew up in Croatia
                    for the first eight years of my life and speak Croatian. When I moved to Switzerland, I learned
                    German, which is my native language. In school, we learned quite good French, which I’d like to
                    refresh. I learned English while staying in Jersey, England. I’ve been speaking Spanish quite well
                    for about three years now.<br>
                    At some point, I discovered a love for travel. This allowed me to get to know foreign countries and
                    expand both my worldview and my language skills. That now comes in handy, as I offer my sessions in
                    multiple languages.
                </p>
                <h3 class="willkommen-title">Inner Gifts</h3>
                <p class="willkommen-paragraph">Since childhood, I’ve seen the entanglements between people that affect
                    their relationships—disrupting, hindering, or blocking them. I feel people and perceive the
                    structure behind them.I struggled with this strong sensitivity well into adulthood. When I finally
                    realized that it was a gift, my perceptive abilities expanded and became more refined and accurate
                    over time.</p>
                <p class="willkommen-paragraph">Sufrí por mi gran sensibilidad hasta la adultez. Cuando finalmente
                    comprendí que era un don, mi capacidad de percepción se amplió y con el tiempo se volvió más fina y
                    precisa. <br>
                    During my long inner journey in Mexico, I was unexpectedly gifted an ability in an initiation from
                    the Ancient Aztecs. From this, an energetic treatment emerged that not only reveals information
                    about a topic but also includes healing on an energetic level. I discovered that the Ancient Aztecs
                    are my spiritual origin—a truly loving and healing source.

                </p>
                <p class="willkommen-paragraph">Even before that, I noticed I could intuitively access information for
                    others. This happened when a friend told me about someone she had met while traveling, and I
                    spontaneously began writing about this woman. To refine this skill, I learned how to read the
                    morphogenetic field. In addition to Family Constellations and energetic healing sessions, I also
                    offer intuitive sessions, and this deep inner sight is incredibly helpful.Everything I offer here
                    serves one purpose: healing.
